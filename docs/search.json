    "text": "Date: 25th - 29th November 2024\nVenue: Nairobi, Kenya\n\n\nWelcome!\nThe course is an in-depth introduction to epidemiology and targets those seeking to conduct epidemiology research or work in the global health space. By the end of the training,¬† participants should be able to:\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the fundamental principles of epidemiology as applied to public health and veterinary science.\nKnow and apply appropriate epidemiological study designs and measures to investigate disease-related events in a population\nCritically analyze epidemiological data and present the results of statistical analyses with appropriate inferences.\nAppropriately evaluate the strengths and limitations of epidemiological studies, including bias, confounding, and effect modification.\nUtilize epidemiological principles to design and conduct studies, interpret diagnostic tests, and apply findings to inform decision-making.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the workshop is to introduce the participants to epidemiological modelling and its application\nThe workshop will be conducted in English with French translation\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nAt the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to\n\nunderstand key concepts of dynamic modelling\ncreate a model world\nunderstand the key methods of fitting models using data\n\n\n\nPre-requisites\n\nBasic familiarity with R\nConcepts of epidemiology"
